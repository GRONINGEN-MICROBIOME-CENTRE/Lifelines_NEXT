# Scripts for manuscript: Mom Matters: Maternal influences on infant gut microbiome and health in 714 mother-infant pairs in the Lifelines NEXT cohort 

### Authors scripts: Trishla Sinha, Alexander Kurilshikov, , Sergio Andreu-Sánchez, Cyrus A. Mallon, Asier Fernández-Pato, Nataliia Kuzub

#### Part 1: Maternal gut microbiome is largely stable during pregnancy and postpartum whereas infant gut microbiome is highly dynamic

#### Part 2: The composition and function of the infant gut microbiome are primarily shaped by the mode of delivery, followed by feeding mode, with additional influences from parity, pre-pregnancy smoking, infections, and diet.

#### Part 3: Characteristics of a complicated labor are associated with a decreased abundance of Bacteroides in vaginal deliveries

#### Part 4: Breastfeeding and later infant dairy intake, but not HMO concentrations in breast milk, are associated with infant gut microbial species

#### Part 5: The infant CAZyme profile is highly dynamic during the first year of life and is shaped by the presence of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Phocaeicola

#### Part 6: Maternal gut microbiome is predictive of infant eczema 

#### Part 7: The maternal gut microbiome is a major reservoir of infant gut strains, with occasional transmission from vaginal and breast milk microbiomes

#### Part 8: Infant microbial intraspecies phylogenies are associated with time, parity and infant complementary food
