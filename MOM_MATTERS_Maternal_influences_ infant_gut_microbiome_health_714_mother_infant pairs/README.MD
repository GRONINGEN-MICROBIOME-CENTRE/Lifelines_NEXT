#### Authors scripts: Trishla Sinha, Alexander Kurilshikov, Sergio Andreu-Sánchez, Cyrus A. Mallon, Asier Fernández-Pato, Nataliia Kuzub

#### General_scripts 
- Functions used accross the manuscipt and demo data 

#### Part 1: Maternal gut microbiome is largely stable during pregnancy and postpartum whereas infant gut microbiome is highly dynamic
- Creating summary stats of predictors and cleaning of predictors 
- PCoA analysis overall composition mothers and infants 
- Inter and intra individual distance comparisons
- Community clustering analysis 
- Scripts pertaining to figures: Figure 1, S1, S2, S3

#### Part 2: The composition and function of the infant gut microbiome are primarily shaped by the mode of delivery, followed by feeding mode, with additional influences from parity, pre-pregnancy smoking, infections, and diet
- MEFISTO analysis 
- PERMANOVA of single timepoints 
- TCAM analysis 
- Associations of predictors with SGB's, alpha diversity, pathways in infants 
- Scripts pertaining to figures: Figure 2, S4

#### Part 3: Characteristics of a complicated labor are associated with a decreased abundance of Bacteroides in vaginal deliveries
- Scripts pertaining to figures: Figure 3


#### Part 4: Infant feeding practices, but not breast milk HMO concentrations, are associated with the infant gut microbiome and its neuroactive potential 
- Associations of predictors with HMO profile in infants 
- Associations of predictors with GBM in infants 
- Scripts pertaining to figures: S5

#### Part 5: The infant CAZyme profile is highly dynamic during the first year of life and is shaped by the presence of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Phocaeicola
- Cleaning CAZYme data
- Associations of CAZYmes with SGB's in mothers and infants 
- Associations of CAZYmes with time point in mothers and infants 
- Associations of CAZYmes with predictors in infants 
- CAZYme subtrate analysis
- Scripts pertaining to figures:Figure 3, S5, S6

#### Part 6: Maternal gut microbiome is predictive of infant eczema 
- Associations of predictors with SGB's, alpha diversity, pathways in mothers 
- Prediction of eczema from maternal microbiome 
- Scripts pertaining to figures: Figure 4


#### Part 7: The maternal gut microbiome is a major reservoir of infant gut strains, with occasional transmission from vaginal and breast milk microbiomes
- Strain transmission of gut strains and its association with time point, predictors and abundances in mothers and infants 
- Strain transmission of breastmilk and vaginal strains
- Scripts pertaining to figures: Figure 5, 6, S7, S8

#### Part 8: Infant microbial intraspecies phylogenies are associated with time, parity and infant complementary food
- PGLMM analysis 
- Scripts pertaining to figures: Figure S9
